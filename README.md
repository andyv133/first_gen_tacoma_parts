# First Gen Toyota Tacoma Parts List


This is a parts list compiled for first generation Toyota Tacomas.

Its on github because that was convenient.

The source for this file is an emacs org-mode file called part_numbers.org.  This is used to generate a markdown file, which can then be turned into any format you can imagine.  I'm using it to make html.
